With that being said, things are a mess right now. Not just the game, but the forums and fallout subreddits seem to be a mass of jumbled chaos so I thought it might be a good way to consolidate all the information out there. This is a compiled list of all known bugs reported so far. I'll do my best to update it as we go. ### Note: This is not a discussion for quality of life changes, suggestions Установка и инструкции.

Thing is, I don't have project nevada installed (anymore) and also have a patch I found online installed too. Any fix?

I've modded the game multiple times, however, I've encountered a bug that I have not seen before that makes my game unplayable. The bug causes my character to not be able to move after switching weapons, after switching weapons my character is stuck in place. I can only look around and my weapons remain sheathed. Sometimes I can open the pip-boy or the menu, but other times I cannot bring up the pip-boy or even press escape. I can't seem to find a way to fix it without going through every single. TL;DR: You can max how fast you can sprint, but things that affect it don’t stack. You can max how long you can sprint, and things that affect it do stack. You can max how long it takes you to recover, and I’ll explore that in the next write-up. amp#x200B; The long: Sprinting FAST : What you need to know: amp#x200B; a. Sprinting is x1.5 faster than running. amp#x200B; b. A power armor frame nerfs your run speed to 88% (Fallout 4 nerfed it to 80%, so improvement, I guess). Okay my game was more of less running smoothly and great for the most part I mean I had an occasional fps stutter but definitely nothing game breaking and sure it would CTD sometimes but it was very few and far between maybe once every 10 hours or so at worst. But suddenly it just starting crashing very frequently and it happens randomly and seemingly with no triggers. Crashed up north near Macready's hospital quest place. crashed in good neighbor and then crashed near greygarden. there

Hey guys, decently new to modding, but I've never played with an overhaul like this, and the load order parameters are strict, I have tried fooling with it myself but after making a few changes I still Crash when hitting "New Game". Any and all help on it would be appreciated Edit: I disabled Homemaker and it stopped crashing and everything works fine, I had the Horizon compatibility patch for Homemaker but so idk why i was crashing with it. Is this a known issue or just something Decided to make a proper Mod list for this Power Armor as I haven't seen one before. First thing first I know someone is going to ask how to get the Power Armor in the first place so just follow this guide on how to unlock the blue print for it ( if I'm missing something from the list let me know in this thread. amp#x200B; Head: Headlamp - Default light. tl;dr: If you have the time and patience, it's actually kind of worthwhile to give yourself a couple of days of totally pretending that encumbrance rules don't exist. EDIT TO ADD: If you're going to do this, have power armour to wear, as it majorly mitigates the movement penalty for being heavily overloaded. Like most of you, I occasionally grow very frustrated with the encumbrance rules in this game, and with the way that you're not really able to just loot everything and benefit. Hi all, Any idea on what mod might be causing these texture pop ins or flickering? It appears to happen in NukaWorld DLC in the Fizztop area and in the maintenance areas just before you fight the first boss with the go-karts. Disabling all mods seems to fix the issue, but I like mods and don't want to do that. Thank you!

This has been my favourite game since 2011 and I've never even complete it. I originally owned it on the 360, my disk got burned before the second battle for Hoover Dam, then I got a new disk, new character, got to the same point, account got hacked and I lost it. Started again on a new account, got to the same point AGAIN and my save corrupts. Eventually got the game on PC. I'm loving the game on PC, running it on Windows 7 and it ran perfectly, rarely ever crashed and I'm getting close I had a backup of Solid Project v18, which as far as I'm aware was the latest version before TommInfinite removed everything.
