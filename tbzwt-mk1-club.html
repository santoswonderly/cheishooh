I've had some pedal trades set up recently that didn't work out, and I've been trying to trade for recording equipment here, but that hasn't worked out either, so here we are again.

Just looking for some advice, rather than researching myself, I thought this would a good place to get some honest reviews/advice. I'm currently looking to upgrade my 800mk2s as it's about time I got with the times and treated myself to something new. Other than the price, is there a major difference between the 700's amp the 1000's and what's your experience from using them both? These are primarily going to be used for practising on within the house, rather than for event. My mixing. Hey guys. This is my second forray in to the Mk1 MR2's, and I'm quite proud of this one. She needs some engine love, but the suspension is entirely redone, and the whole car is rust-free. More pictures to come as I get the engine built up properly, new wheels and tires, etc. Let me know what you think. Hi! Realised that I'm actually heavier than I look and I'm in the threshold for the standard laser rig weight. I don't want to pay the £540 for the brand new Mk.2 sail found here (https://www.laserperformance.uk/Sail-Laser-MK-II-Class-Legal_3?lang=en) as I'm only going to be club racing at the moment. I was planning on using a a Rooster Mk1 Standard sail (Which I've already got) for training, and a Mk.2 training sail found here (https://www.purplemarine.com/catalog/product/view/id/29765?gcl. Hello, just wondering if someone can give me a good tutorial on how to clean a CDJ-800 MK1 without risking to damage any of the parts when I take it apart. I have a pair of CDJs that were used in a club for over 2 years and they took in a lot of dust, cigarette ash, beer and other alcoholic beverages. They are still functional but some of the parts are sticky and full on dirty and I can't afford a professional service. Thanks. Imagine you were in charge of GTA Onlines big quality of life update. What would you include? amp#x200B; Mine would be: amp#x200B; FREEMODE AND DELIVERIES: Vehicles with autolock can't use this feature on any delivery vehicle, across the board. Changes to the way freemode deliveries work: Players are now rewarded for stealing and delivering the package themselves, across the board. Destroying a delivery vehicle, however, will cause the attacker to recieve an insurance. My goal in this post is to detail the energy requirements of each item and have it all in one place. The way to calculate is simple, take the energy requirement of the building (4MW, 50MW, etc.) and multiply that by the number of seconds it takes to create 1 item. This gives you the energy cost in megajoules. Megajoules are helpful as you can directly translate these costs to things like biofuel, coal, fuel, etc. First I’ll give you the energy values of fuel: Biomass: 120MJ Alien Carapace.

Hello. Read this excerpts from Paranoia-live.net (https://Paranoia-live.net) forum about RampD gadgets. Stuff marked in Bold . Author names just goes before their texts. Moto42 EMP Bomb A black box about the size of a shoebox, in fact it appears to be a sheet-metal shoe-box painted black. There is a single red button on the top and it's rather heavy for something that size. When activated the device will begin beeping, with the button flashing in time to the beeps. The beeps I didn't get to sit down and enjoy the game from release, which was a huge bummer at the time as MK is my favorite Videogame series of all time. MK9 was a fantastic return to form, and now that I've dove into MKX i can firmly say it's my favorite in the series altogether. The Kombat is extremely fast paced, visually entertaining and technical enough to warrant experimentation. Almost every kharacter is viable, or at least fun to play. Art style, though desaturated, fits the game perfectly. A few days ago I made a post regarding my low optimism on the upcoming Need for Speed 2019. At the end I wrote that I will be writing a longer post soon about how the NFS 2019 should look like. Soon has passed. NOTE: The opinion here is completely mine and whether you like it or not, so don't be that guy that says: "You didn't mention blahblahblah" or "How can you say this blahblahblah". I will touch these points: car list and customization, gameplay, tuning, map, soundtrack, story I am level 169, on the brink of reaching 170. I have a CEO Office, Nightclub, Motorcycle Club and almost ready to get a bunker (bunker because I need the MOC to upgrade my oppresor mk1) I have all the essential land and air vehicles that are good for grinding and missions I am ok with all ages. Just please be mature (I am 17) Hmu if you wanna play Psn: ThatCreativeAcid. Happy labor day weekend and sorry I've taken so long. I wrote a little bit each day when and where I could spare a moment but didn't really finish the story until after work today. For those unfamiliar with the on-going SN Darwinism saga, basically Harry from "Dumb and Dumber" enlisted in the US Coast Guard and shenanigans ensue. On to the story. Only jargon here is "head" which means "bathroom" for the sea-going services (including marines as well) as well as "bilge" which just means Just swapped out the crappy stock speakers in my Skoda Octavia Mk1 with a pair of JBL Club 6500c (https://www.jbl.com/car-audio-systems/CLUB+6500C.html). The speakers are hooked up to a SONY DSX-A500BD (https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/in-car-receivers-players/dsx-a500bd/specifications) Head unit using the existing car wires and an ISO adapter. Everything sounded pretty good, considering it was a pretty cheap upgrade. However, after driving around for 2-3 hours , testing the speakers. Hey everyone so last Saturday night I played my very first set at a club! In this post I’ll be going over what went well and what advise I can give to those who haven’t yet done any clubs. So first off the gear used at the club was 2x XDJ 1000s (Mk1) and a DJM 700. This threw me off a little bit as I practice with an RX2, and the lack of physical buttons threw me off. So be prepared to use older gear and not what you’re used to. The next one which is my fault is, if you’re someone
