                            <p>Сайт о Acer, eMachines и Packard Bell и не только. Hi all, I have an Acer v3-571G (BIOS v2.21) laptop with integrated 710M and HD4000 graphics. I've been running an eGPU setup succesfully for the past year now with a MSI GTX970 and an EXP GDC Beast adapter, both powered by a 600W Zalman ATX PSU. It worked perfectly for a year, but a few weeks ago I was messing with the graphics drivers to solve a minor brightness problem on my laptop, and my PC isn't detecting the eGPU anymore. When I was messing with the drivers the eGPU was disconnected В ноутбуках фирмы Acer есть одна замечательная и удобная функция для восстановления Windows, без использования дисков с образом системы. 
I'LL SPARE YOU the suspense and just quote Acer directly: The 2019 release of the Swift 5 is ''the world's lightest notebook Computer using a 15-inch display.'' Given the plethora of ultralight laptops on the h6y89aa abb (https://www.3cparts.de/original-h6y89aaabb-hp-45mm-30mm-65w-netzteil-p-10550.html) market place now, that is no modest feat.Once you choose 1 up for the very first time, you'd be forgiven for pondering it really is a child's toy-or possibly among those phony plastic laptop.

I am trying to format an Acer Aspire V3-571g. For a week now the laptop started freezing randomly letting me no option but to go for a hard shut down. The last couple of days this is way worse since it freezes literally seconds after the desktop opens up. So I created my bootable USB and went for it. The issue is that no matter what I can't make it boot from the USB. I have it first in my boot order but it looks like it's completely ignoring that. Doing a bit of research it looks Включение touchpad в БИОС. Если у вас не работает тачпад и предыдущие советы не помогают, возможно, он просто отключен в настройках. Hello, My laptop has suddenly decided to overheat, looks like it was after some software updates (CPU temperatures of 85-90 C from idle). I've tried to boot with older kernels to no avail, so I did a fresh install and nothing changed (before and after zypper up since the install was not networked) It's definitely software as Windows cools down fine So far I've tried unsuccessfully: TLP thermald acpi\_osi=Linux acpi.power\_nocheck=1 noacpi sensors-config pwmconfig

Hey I have the Acer Aspire V3-571G and tried to update my BIOS. When the flash programmer, downloaded from Acers website, tried to flash the new BIOS the laptop froze completely (fan was still running very fast, no power to USB devices, no display) After a while I unplugged the laptop and removed the battery (power button didn’t do anything) and tried to start up again but it’s doing nothing. No LED lights no power whatsoever. I’ve disassembled it removes the RAM, HDD, DVD ROM, CMOS. Tried.

I was able to run Dota 2 and Skyrim before with no problems, even having a constant 40 FPS on Dota 2. But since I had to reformat my laptop, I can't play any game anymore on my laptop. My laptop is a two-year old Acer Aspire v3-571g which has; Intel i5-2450m (2.5gHz and can be maxed out to 3.1gHz) 8 gigabytes of RAM (previously 4GB but was upgraded to 8 after the reformat) Nvidia GT 630M with 2gb VRAM My current BIOS version is v1.08.

Hi, so my laptop says with turbo boost, I can be getting around 3.2GHz instead of 2.6GHz but I don't know if I even have it or is it even activated. I have looked around and people have been saying to go to BIOS, which I did, but there's no option for me, so I assume I do not have it but is there a way for me to get it or turn it on? My laptop is a acer aspire v3-571g-6622. Would turbo boost help me at all? My games runs ok but cpu gets high and sometimes stays Ребят, помогите! Возможно этот вопрос уже звучал здесь, но все же. Вообщем, моя проблема такова: еще несколько месяцев назад я сидел на виндувс. I made a post about this a week ago and received help from /u/flakmaster92 but in the end we were unable to solve the problem and he recommended me to make a new post about my problem.

Someone turned my PC off in the middle of a windows 8.1 update. When I turned it on, my laptop made a beeping noise every other second for about 20 seconds. After booting, I get the infamous "No bootable device" message. (To emphasize 
My Acer aspire V3-571G doesn't support Win10 but I've installed it along with some 3rd party drivers to make it work. I have bios version 2.15 now and if I upgrade it to 2.21 will win10 still work? Because 2.21 is for win 8 and 8.1 not for win10. But I think the 2.15 bios version that I have now is most likely for win8 too so I don't think it would make a difference? But maybe the bios update has to be made from win8 or 8.1 since Acer don't support win10? If anything would go wrong during updat. This is the first time I've installed skyrim, I've never played it before. So i do not have any mods, but i do have the 3 dlcs. I've disabled them but i still cannot get past the intro without crashing.

So I finally bought my first hard drive. I have no idea how to use it. I know you can drag and drop files into it and I'm probably making it seem harder than it really is but I want to make sure I'm doing it right. I have to send my laptop to get repaired and I need to make sure all my files are safe. Not only that, but I'm not sure if I have to copy my game files as well. I mostly have Steam games but I don't TL;DR: My Nvidia card does not work after failed driver update So, i was going to update my drivers, everything went right exept for the reboot, after the reboot i thought it was done, so i went to play a game. After a min or 2 dropped my frames to 10-15 fps. So i went to change the graphics card from Intel HD Graphics to the Nvidia card. but it wasn't there. I checked if it was on the device manager, and it was hidden with code 45. After that i checked if there were solutions to my problem. Hello all, this is my first attempt at building some kind of budget (0-00 with peripherals) gaming PC that will be able to last me through college. As the title says, I have no experience whatsoever building a PC prior to this attempt but I have always been interested in the experience and being able to build something with my own income. In the past I have been using an Acer Aspire V3-571G laptop that is relatively decent but I thought I wanted a bit of an upgrade from the laptop experien. I have an acer aspire v3-571G with windows 8.1 yesterday I got some windows updates, and as always I accepted and did them. after all it asked my computer to restart, it restarted and now on the startup my laptop is freeze in 6/7 update for 8 hours or more I tried to restart it and go to BIOS but I can't reach it, I tried every F key and nothing I'm sorry if this post is out of place on this subreddit, but I've been really struggling for a long time with this issue and I've tried so many things that never managed to do anything and you guys seem to know what you're talking about when it comes to PCs, so maybe someone can give me an answer that gets me somewhere. So first thing's first, I have an Acer Aspire V3-571G-6641, which you can find a newegg 
I've purchased the upgrade version of Windows 8 through the offer on microsofts own site. But when I launch games, it's now stuck with the Intel 3000 and not the nvidia gt630m. Does anyone have a solution? I have browsed google for 2hours now :( The pc is an Acer Aspire V3-571G. I've tried to disable the intel 3000 in device manager, making the nvidia card the prefered card in the nvidia settings. I also entered BIOS to see if I could disable the integrated graphics card, but could My fiancee's laptop (Acer Aspire v3 571g 9686) is getting a black screen after the Acer splash screen. The last thing that happened on her laptop was a message saying "Repairing C:\ drive". It got to about 40% and went black. When we restarted it, it got to the Acer splash screen, then goes black. No sounds come out of the laptop. I've tried removing the battery and holding down the power button for 2 minutes, which seems to work according to the Acer forums. I've tried to access Hello I own a Acer Aspire V3-571G laptop. Recently I have upgraded to Windows 10 (doing a clean install, not the upgrade). Every time I make an action involving relatively high network traffic (1080p youtube, 480p full-screen, downloading etc.) I lose internet connection. This only affects the wired connection. The WiFi works perfectly. When the internet is gone I have to disable/enable the network adapter or restart the computer but the problem occurs again if I, say, watch 1080p youtube. Today I noticed something strange. One of the USB 2.0 ports on my laptop stopped working. I am not exactly sure when this issue started as I was on holiday (staying home) and was using a USB hub, but once I was back to work, I needed all the USB ports and noticed one not working. What I can tell already is the following: When running dmesg tail -20 after plugging in the USB drive I get the following errors: usb 3-3: new full-speed USB device number 8 using xhci_hcd usb 3-3: device. Alright, so first a bunch of details. If this post is too long I'm sorry. I just like to be as informative as possible, and this really is important to me because it's driving me crazy. The more I tell the more I can be given advice on what to do. Keep in mind that I'm fairly technologically illiterate and so I don't know what information is needed, but I'll be happy to find it for you if you tell me how. I have an Acer Aspire V3-571G-6641.

My laptop (Acer Aspire V3-571G) has an SSD in the main drive bay, and the old HDD in the optical drive bay. Both boot Windows7/Ubuntu. The BIOS lets me set boot priority, but doesn't distinguish between the two disks. It defaults to the HDD, and I have to F12 every time to boot from the SSD. On the BIOS information screen it shows the hard drive as being the SSD and makes no mention of the HDD. The SSD is a Crucial M500, the HDD is a Hitachi something, can look it up if needed.
